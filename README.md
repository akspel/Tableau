I looked only at the 2019 data for this and compared summer months usage vs. winter months usage.  For the summer months I looked at June, July, and August.  For the winter months I looked at December, January, and February.  

I used pandas to join the csv and create a data frame for both summer and winter.

From there I looked at a breakdown of subscribers who use the bike vs those one time use customers.  In the summer there is a steady growth of subscribers.  In the winter it stays consistent with a dip towards one time use for February.

Next I looked at gender breakdown based on trip duration.  Both in the summer and winter months there is more female riders then male.

Lastly I looked at starting locations and average trip durations from those spots.  In the summer the highest average trips started at Pershing Field and Liberty Light Rail Stations.  During the winter the average trip durations came from Jackson Square.

Overall, there are difference between winter and summer riders.  In the summer it would be more probable for people to ride which would lead to diversity in the starting stations.  For winter it would become more focused starting spots with fewer riders.
